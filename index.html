                  Circles of different shades, sizes, velocities, and at different positions are generated so what should
                  happen is that, at some point, all the balls exit the canvas and disappear forever unless the page is reloaded.

                  A clump of 500 circles of various sizes and densities are created when the page opens up. They all slowly move
                  outwards and after a while the circles withdraw back into their original positions; this loops repeats itself infinitely.
                  If you look closely, it appears as if we were traveling into the balls and then moving backwards.

                  Leaving ball-related ideas for now, I decided to make a line-related idea. Also, since I haven't worked with spinning objects
                  for a whilte now, I made this sketch. What happens is that lines spawn in at random positions and lengths and they spin; the longer
                  a line spins the more faded it gets until it disappears.

                These two new rectangles have the same function and continues splitting until the limit of 500 rectangles is reached.</p>

              to pulse red and then explode, projecting out other smaller circles that look like particles.</p>

                  How the sketch works was completely unintended. My coding counselor made a kind of canvas where you
                  could code on and it would function like the one in a browse but his version is more convenient. And instead of actually clearing
                  the canvas each update, his canvas would just lay another translucent layer on top. So what happens if you have objects moving
                  around, it would look like they have trails. So using that concept, I had a dark background and 1500 circles to start with in the middle, expanding
                  out and more spawning in the same position as it continues. This makes it look like we were traveling through space.

                  Following the "clear-screen" physics of the last sketch that I made, I got down to making another sketch
                  like that. This one involves having 2 animations playing on the screen at once. And like the title suggests
                  the animations involve fireballs. The animation that is positioned above would have red fireballs spawning
                  while the one below it has green. The fireballs leave particles as they fly around and can bounce off the walls
                  and each other. Once a fireball has bounced enough times, it gets weakened and will eventually explode,
                  projecting even more particles. However, be warned that this might get laggy as your device handles this week's
                  sketch.
