                  This is my first sketch so I went easy and made it simple but still interseting to watch.
                  Circles of different shades, sizes, velocities, and at different positions are generated so what should
                  happen is that, at some point, all the balls exit the canvas and disappear forever unless the page is reloaded.

                  A clump of 500 circles of various sizes and densities are created when the page opens up. They all slowly move
                  outwards and after a while the circles withdraw back into their original positions; this loops repeats itself infinitely.
                  If you look closely, it appears as if we were traveling into the balls and then moving backwards.

                  Leaving ball-related ideas for now, I decided to make a line-related idea. Also, since I haven't worked with spinning objects
                  for a whilte now, I made this sketch. What happens is that lines spawn in at random positions and lengths and they spin; the longer
                  a line spins the more faded it gets until it disappears.

                <p>I decided to try a calmer idea this time since all the previous sketchs were more on the active side and so I settled on an imitation of our solar system.
                This is the result and it looks quite neat. However, the sketch doesn't have accurate measurements and everything.</p>

                <p>Got this idea from my brother and made it as my 5th sketch. To me, it's quite satisfying to see the
                sketch work its wonders. At the start, there's a big, moving rectangle and it splits into two when it hits a wall.
                These two new rectangles have the same function and continues splitting until the limit of 500 rectangles is reached.</p>

                <p>Approaching the field of particles for the first time, I came up with a really basic example, exploding balls.
                A bunch of circles of different sizes spawn at each 50 ticks. The circles are faint at first but become darker and start
              to pulse red and then explode, projecting out other smaller circles that look like particles.</p>

                <p>
                  How the sketch works was completely unintended. My coding counselor made a kind of canvas where you
                  could code on and it would function like the one in a browse but his version is more convenient. And instead of actually clearing
                  the canvas each update, his canvas would just lay another translucent layer on top. So what happens if you have objects moving
                  around, it would look like they have trails. So using that concept, I had a dark background and 1500 circles to start with in the middle, expanding
                  out and more spawning in the same position as it continues. This makes it look like we were traveling through space.
